# Structural-bioinformatics
[Final practical exam](https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/tree/main/vmd)
</br>
this exam include :
</br>
<ul>
  Use the advanced search of the PDB database and select the data that has a protein with a length of more than 300 amino acids and a chemical 
  molecule that has been determined by X-Ray crystallography with a resolution of less than 2 Ã….
  <li>Show the search method with a picture and write the pdb code, name and type of protein and chemical molecule of your choice.</li>
  <li>Display the 3D image of the complex in VMD, also display the chemical molecule and its binding site</li>
  <li>How long is the selected protein naturally? Has the full length of the protein been X-ray crystallographed? Are they located at the junction       with the chemical molecule, missing residue or missing atom?</li>
  <li>Are there any special pattern(s) reported as signature of your protein domain(s)?</li>
  <li>[Design a procedure that specifies the amino acid sequence and the percentage of hydrophobic, positively charged, negatively charged, and         neutral polar amino acids](https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/vmd/5.tcl)</li>
  <li>[Design a procedure to find the amino acids involved in disulfide bonds. Please compare the result with the information available in the PDB database](https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/vmd/6.tcl)</li>
