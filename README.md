[practical practice:](https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/tree/main/HW2)
practical practice include:
<br>
<ul>
  Download a 3D protein structure file determined by NMR from the PDB database (mention the PDB code of the selected protein) and calculate the         following using VMD software and Tcl scripting
  <li>Calculate the sequence of amino acids and the number of each type of amino acid (20 types of amino acids) in that protein.<a href="https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/HW2/answer1.txt">asnwer 1</a></li>
  <li>A new procedure should be designed so that the sequence of the second structure of different protein models (frames) is written in an output file and the percentage of the types of second structures of the models is also calculated.<a href="https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/HW2/answer2.text">asnwer 2</a>.<a href="https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/HW2/answer2.tcl">tcl file</a></li>
  <li>Calculate the phi and psi angles for a protein model and draw the Ramachandran diagram using any language you are fluent in.<a href="https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/HW2/answer3.txt">asnwer 3</a></li>
  <li>A new procedure should be designed to load the pdb file and calculate the RMSD matrix two by two of all the frames of a protein and write it in the output file.<a href="https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/HW2/answer4.txt">asnwer 4</a>.<a href="https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/HW2/answer4.tcl">tcl file</a></li>
  <li>Design a new procedure that outputs amino acid number, amino acid name, second structure type of that amino acid, dihedral angles phi, psi, omega and Radius of gyration for the atoms involved in hydrogen bonding.<a href="https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/HW2/answer5.txt">asnwer 5</a>.<a href="https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/HW2/answer5.tcl">tcl file</a></li>

[Final practical exam:](https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/tree/main/vmd)
</br>
this exam include :
</br>
<ul>
  Use the advanced search of the PDB database and select the data that has a protein with a length of more than 300 amino acids and a chemical 
  molecule that has been determined by X-Ray crystallography with a resolution of less than 2 Ã….
  <li>Show the search method with a picture and write the pdb code, name and type of protein and chemical molecule of your choice.</li>
  <li>Display the 3D image of the complex in VMD, also display the chemical molecule and its binding site</li>
  <li>How long is the selected protein naturally? Has the full length of the protein been X-ray crystallographed? Are they located at the junction       with the chemical molecule, missing residue or missing atom?</li>
  <li>Are there any special pattern(s) reported as signature of your protein domain(s)?</li>
  <li>[Design a procedure that specifies the amino acid sequence and the percentage of hydrophobic, positively charged, negatively charged, and         neutral polar amino acids](https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/vmd/5.tcl)</li>
  <li>[Design a procedure to find the amino acids involved in disulfide bonds. Please compare the result with the information available in the PDB database] (https://github.com/abolfazlmalekahmadi/Structural-bioinformatics/blob/main/vmd/6.tcl)</li>

</ul>
